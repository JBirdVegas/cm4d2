Hey all JBirdVegas here I hope you can help

OK Thanks to cvpcs for all his work on Droid X CM Port 
Most of the initial commits are just shadow changed to droid2

His source I forked to start with is @ github.com/cvpcs

Thanks to The CyanogenMod Project for the awesome ROM!

This is experimental and you should be booting with logcat running as you may bootloop durring the hijack ... what can I say it's an ALPHA release
